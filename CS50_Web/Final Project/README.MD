This project is a Django-based web application for managing blog posts. Users can create, view, edit, and delete blog posts. The application includes features such as user authentication, post creation, post listing, post details, and post editing.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

### Distinctiveness

This project satisfies the distinctiveness requirement by implementing custom features and functionalities beyond basic CRUD operations. Some distinctive features include:

- User authentication: Users can register, log in, and log out securely.
- Profile management: Users can view and update their profiles, including their usernames and passwords.
- Image upload: Users can upload images to accompany their blog posts.
- Favorite posts: Users can mark posts as favorites and view their favorite posts in a dedicated section.

### Complexity

The project demonstrates complexity through several aspects:

- Custom user model: The project uses a custom user model to extend the functionality of the built-in User model provided by Django.
- Class-based views: Views are implemented using Django's class-based views for better code organization and reusability.
- Frontend design: The project includes custom styling using CSS to improve the user interface and user experience.
- JavaScript integration: JavaScript is used to enhance interactivity, such as making images responsive and handling favorite post actions asynchronously.
